# NVIDIA Stock Price Forecasting App

This Streamlit app predicts NVIDIA‚Äôs next closing stock price using a **Tuned CNN-LSTM Model A**, trained exclusively on NVIDIA stock data with engineered features and optimized hyperparameters via Optuna.

## üöÄ Features
- Upload preprocessed and normalized 60√ó35 CSV sequence
- Predict next-day NVIDIA closing price
- Tuned CNN-LSTM architecture (Conv1D ‚Üí LSTM ‚Üí Dense)
- Uses TensorFlow (.keras) model and MinMaxScaler for output inversion
- Interactive Streamlit UI for fast deployment and testing

## üõ† How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
3. Start the app:

4. Upload your 60√ó35 normalized CSV to receive prediction

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `app.py`                   | Streamlit web interface                              |
| `best_tuned_lstm_optuna.keras` | Tuned CNN-LSTM A (NVIDIA-only) model              |
| `minmaxscaler.pkl`         | MinMaxScaler for reversing normalization             |
| `requirements.txt`         | Python dependencies                                  |
| `.devcontainer/`           | (Optional) VS Code Dev Container setup               |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Input Requirements
- CSV shape must be **(60, 35)** ‚Äî 60 time steps with 35 engineered NVIDIA-only features.
- Ensure the input is normalized using the same `MinMaxScaler` used during training.
